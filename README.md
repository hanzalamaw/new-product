The e-commerce industry in Pakistan, particularly in cities like Karachi, is growing rapidly —  
yet **operational inefficiencies** continue to limit scalability and profitability.

- Shopify lacks **local team structures & workflows**.  
- Businesses must give staff **full access** to sensitive dashboards → risks misuse.  
- **Order fulfillment** spans multiple tools → delays & mismatches.  
- No **centralized, role-based system** for multi-channel operations.

- Provides **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**.
